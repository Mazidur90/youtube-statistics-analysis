# Problem: A popular magazine wants to publish an article about how much youube is contributing to our Daily Life, they want really see the how many channels are viewd over different areas of the world and they also want to know which channels post videos of 
what content. So they as their technical intern to handle the problem
# technicalIntern ( Mazidur ): Perfect! i will get the public data relesed by youtube itself and clean the data for most imapctful contents. i will also generate ba heatmap which you guys can se understand what type content
are watched on whoch continents and I will also generate all the charts on the tima stamp basis so that you guys know how you want to  forecast your newss.

Application \//// Description: So thsi is a classical Data handling problem with data base. Nomally this kind of data sets are often clouded with non essential data like hashtags, repeatability and also junk data like 
having 0 values and also having weird kind of datas at different locations also maybe of different formats in btween the dataset of 1000 or 1 millon of rows and columns, so finding the faulty data from this huge dataset
requires GPU power for data data rendering, using simple data query in SQL and Excel can't handle these problems. I also tried with power _BI to tackle this problem, the problem that happened is that it was ignoring any kind 
of data that was popualted with string whrere as alll the other data were in float format, therefore i had to perform Python operation in thhe power-BI python shell to tacakle this problem, Hence using Python alone this the best suited use for me.
